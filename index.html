            This is my biggest and most complex work so far. It's a partial clone of a big commercial site
            where I checked the original site's look and functionality and implemented the same without
            copying any of the site's code.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Responsive design implemented on each page. Separate navigation/search menu for mobile mode</li>
            <li>A complex Sort and Filter widget stores all its state data in Redux</li>
            <li>Fully functional search bar (matches movies where title contains all words from the query)</li>
            <li>Movie data is hosted on Google Firebase. Each movie page view updates the viewcount in the database</li>
            <li>Decorative elements on all pages move in response to mouse cursor movement, which is tracked using a custom hook</li>

            This is my latest work so it's the best example of my code quality. </p>
          <p>This project heavily focuses on logic while using barebones styling.
            Doesn't work on mobile devices as they don't support drag-and-drop natively, but I might
            look into it later.

            <li>Drag and drop any module from the left pane to add it to the calculator</li>
            <li>Rearrange modules in the calculator by dragging them. Display module is always on top and it can't be moved</li>
            <li>Remove modules from the calculator by double clicking them</li>
            <li>Click the "Runtime" button to enable the calculator's buttons. It will work even if not all modules are added.</li>

            I didn't develop this app myself&nbsp;&mdash; it's a code-along project, i.e.
            I made it by following
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/">this 
            online training course</a>. However I do understand each step so I can reproduce the whole
            project, and I've implemented some parts of the app on my own
            (wherever the instructor suggested this as a challenge for students).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Uses Firebase to store product data and authenticate users</li>
            <li>

              password
            </li>
            <li>Fully functional Product Cart</li>
            <li>Uses Redux to manage all state data</li>
            <li>Uses react-router-dom library to implement navigation</li>
